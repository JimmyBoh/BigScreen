BigScreen
=========

Browser bookmarklet to maximize a YouTube video to it's fullest potential!

**NOTE:** The latest changes to YouTube.com have made the "Large Screen" option fit to the size of your screen. So this really isn't useful anymore! Horray for easy!

## To Use:

Open `dist/bookmarklet.js` and copy the text into a bookmark!
